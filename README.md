#Sorting Visuzalizer

###Hello What's Up?Let me walk you through my very first project üòÅ

Description:-
Since I am very facinated with Data Strcutures and Algorithm . So I have implemented this project to visualize all the sorting Algorithms.This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JS. Sorting visualizer is a very simple UI and it allows the users to select the sort algorithm, select the array size, and speed of the visualization.

Motive to make this project ??
The main reason I choose this project to become more familiar with the javascript concepts, and CSS styling. So, I didn't use any frameworks other than HTML, CSS, and JS.

Output after successful completion of this project??
Now I'm familiar with the JS concepts, can confidently solve coding problems, write stylings in CSS.
