<h1>Sorting Visuzalizer</h1>

<h3>Hello What's Up?Let me walk you through my very first project üòÅ</h3>

<b>Description:-</b><br/>
Since I am very facinated with Data Strcutures and Algorithm . So I have implemented this project to visualize all the sorting Algorithms.This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JS. Sorting visualizer is a very simple UI and it allows the users to select the sort algorithm, select the array size, and speed of the visualization.

<b>Motive to make this project ??</b><br/>
The main reason I choose this project to become more familiar with the javascript concepts, and CSS styling. So, I didn't use any frameworks other than HTML, CSS, and JS.

<b>Output after successful completion of this project??</b><br/>
Now I'm familiar with the JS concepts, can confidently solve coding problems, write stylings in CSS.
